"Minimum Time Needed to Reach Destination using Heuristics"
This system has been designed to optimize transportation logistics by  minimizing travel time between two destinations. In contexts where various route options are available, our primary objective is to identify and recommend the most efficient route. This route not only reduces travel time but also mitigates barriers and obstacles encountered during the journey.
